# How To Flash a target usign ST-Link utility

This is a guide on how to manually flash the firmware using ST-Link utility.

## Introduction

There are two images to be flashed in the target, one for nanoBooter and another one for nanoCLR.

1. Download the [STM32 ST-LINK Utility](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/stsw-link004.html) from ST web site and install it in your development machine.

1. Download a ZIP file with the firmware for the board from our web site [here](https://github.com/nanoframework/nf-interpreter#firmware-for-reference-boards) by clicking on the appropriate badge. This will take you to our JFrog Bintray repository that holds the packages with pre-build images for several target boards. After downloading it, unzip the package contents.

1. Connect the target board to your PC using an USB cable. Note that on most ST deveopement boards there are two micro USB connectors. To follow this guide you'll want to use the one that's providing the JTAG connection through the ST-Link debugger. In doubt, check the PCB for the correct one or the board schematic.

1. Launch the ST-LINK Utility that you've just installed and connect to the ST board.

1. Perform a "full chip erase" to clear the flash.

1. Load the `nanoBooter.hex` file from the package and hit the "Program and verify" button. Make sure you tick the "Reset after programming" check box and hit "Start". After the upload completes, the MCU is reset and the nanoBooter image runs. You can check the success of the operation watching for a slow blink pattern on the LED. Congratulations, you now have a board running nanoFramework's booter!

1. Next, load the `nanoCLR.hex` file from the extracted package folder and hit again the "Program and verify" button. Make sure you tick the "Reset after programming" check box and hit "Start". After the upload completes, the MCU is reset and the nanoCLR image will run. This time and if all goes as expected, there will be no LED blinking. You can check if the board is properly running .NET **nanoFramework** by looking into the Device Explorer window in VS.
