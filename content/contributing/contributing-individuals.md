# Contributing individuals

.NET **nanoFramework** was started from individual contributions and keeps growing based on those.
That's very important for the project and we sure would love to have you onboard!

The project needs people with skills on C/C++ and C# and Azure DevOps. No need to be a subject matter expert! Even the smallest contribution matters.

We welcome embedded system developers familiar with platforms we target, including: ESP32, STM32, TI CC32xx and NXP. Or are familiar with RTOSes, including: FreeRTOS, ChibiOS and TI SimpleLink.

C# developers with general coding experiencing, coding Visual Studio extension development, coding with Visual Studio debugging components, willing to write unit tests.

Technical writers that want to get experience, gain knowledge on a new platform or technology or just wanting to contribute voluntarily.

Designers, video editors, web designers and people with marketing and PR skills. Basically the project can benefit from good communication, presenting good and nice looking materials, provide great and engaging training materials.
