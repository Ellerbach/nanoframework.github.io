# Project priorities

We're working hard to have a wide support od targets, a proper way of building them, deploying them and of course documentation. We have our Discord channel where our top priority is to help each others, answer questions. So [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/AE4Yxrvt)!

Any help is always appreciated, we love your PR! Keep them coming in :-)
